# Highpass-filter-to-3D-xarray.DataArray-using-DASK
This code applies a high-pass filter to a 3D xarray.DataArray (e.g., SLA) along its time dimension, using the Butterworth filter from SciPy. The filtered data removes low-frequency variations with periods longer than 30 days.  Dask compatibility enabled.
